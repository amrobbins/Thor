# Contributing

This framework has been developed to the point where it's core is there and it needs to be fleshed out.
I have limited time that I am able to work on it, since I have a full time job and so I am looking for
help to do this from interested developers.

If you are interested in contributing to this new framework, please contact Andrew Robbbins
at AndrewRobbins@hotmail.com.
