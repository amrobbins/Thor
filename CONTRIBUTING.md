# Contributing

This framework has been developed to the point where its core is there and it needs to be fleshed out.
I have limited time that I am able to work on it, since I work a full time job and so I am looking for
help to do this from interested developers.

If you are interested in contributing to this new framework, please contact Andrew Robbbins
at AndrewRobbins@hotmail.com.

Andrew Robbins is the owner and Chief Architect of Thor.

Any dependency added to this project needs to be approved by Andrew Robbins.

I need to find a core group of maintainers. I believe that this is the fastest AI framework that exists. If you are someone that knows about building deep learning frameworks, I need the help and if you are interested in being involved in this project, please reach out to me. I'd like to spend all of my time working on this but the reality is that I have big time commitments with my actual job. I think this is the most impotant compute workload today and also that this is by far the fastest executor of that, and I am looking for head maintainers. So if that fits you, please let me know, I very much want this project to be realized in industry.
